District-Wide School Performance Data Analysis
Python | Pandas | Jupyter Notebook

Developed a full data analysis report for a large urban school district, aggregating and analyzing standardized test results from thousands of students across multiple schools.

Created dynamic summaries of district-wide performance, including total budget, per-student spending, average math and reading scores, and overall passing rates.

Designed detailed school-level reports highlighting school type, budget, academic performance, and passing percentages, using dataframes and groupby operations in Pandas.

Built specialized performance breakdowns by grade level, school spending categories, school size, and school type, enabling more targeted analysis and data-driven decision making.

Produced visualizations and tabular summaries to identify trends â€” such as smaller schools outperforming larger schools and lower per-student spending correlating with lower test scores.

Delivered a final written report summarizing key trends and providing actionable insights for strategic budgeting and resource allocation decisions.

Key Insights:

Smaller schools (fewer than 1,000 students) had significantly higher overall passing rates compared to larger schools.

Schools with higher per-student spending showed better average math and reading performance.
